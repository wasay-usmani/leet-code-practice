# Min Stack (LeetCode 155)

**Problem:**
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

**Operations:**
- `Push(x int)`: Push element x onto stack.
- `Pop()`: Removes the element on top of the stack.
- `Top() int`: Get the top element.
- `GetMin() int`: Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

**Example:**

Input:
```
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]
```
Output:
```
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]
```

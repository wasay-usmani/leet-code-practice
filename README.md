# LeetCode Grind: NeetCode 150

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, following the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) grind. Each problem is organized in its own directory with a README containing the problem description, a Go solution, and test cases.

## Structure

- Each problem is in its own folder under a relevant topic (e.g., `arrays/contains-duplicate`).
- Each folder contains:
  - `README.md`: Problem statement and constraints
  - `solution.go`: Go implementation (with function stub or solution)
  - `solution_test.go`: Test cases for the solution

## Why NeetCode 150?

The NeetCode 150 is a curated list of essential LeetCode problems to help you master coding interviews efficiently. This repo is my journey through those problems, with clean code and tests for each.

Happy grinding!

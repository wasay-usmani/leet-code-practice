# Balanced Binary Tree (LeetCode 110)

**Problem:**
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

**Function signature:**
```go
func isBalanced(root *TreeNode) bool
```

**Input:**
- The root node of a binary tree

**Output:**
- `true` if the tree is height-balanced, `false` otherwise

**Example:**

Input:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
Output:
```
true
```

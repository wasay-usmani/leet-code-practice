# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

LeetCode: [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

## Problem
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

**Example:**

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

## Function Signature
```go
func levelOrder(root *TreeNode) [][]int
```

# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree (LeetCode 235)

**Problem:**
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

**Function signature:**
```go
func lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q *TreeNode) *TreeNode
```

**Input:**
- The root node of a BST
- Two nodes p and q in the BST

**Output:**
- The lowest common ancestor node

**Example:**

Input:
```
root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
```
Output:
```
6
```

# Same Tree (LeetCode 100)

**Problem:**
Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Function signature:**
```go
func isSameTree(p *TreeNode, q *TreeNode) bool
```

**Input:**
- The roots of two binary trees

**Output:**
- `true` if the trees are the same, `false` otherwise

**Example:**

Input:
```
p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
```
Output:
```
true
```

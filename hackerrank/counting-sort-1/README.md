# Counting Sort 1 (HackerRank)

**Problem:**
Given a list of integers where each value is in the range [0, 99], return a frequency array for the values in the input as described in counting sort.

**Function signature:**
```go
func CountingSort(arr []int) []int
```

**Input:**
- An array of integers in the range [0, 99]

**Output:**
- An array of 100 integers where the value at each index i is the number of times i appears in the input array

**Example:**

Input:
```
arr = [1, 1, 3, 2, 1]
```
Output:
```
[0 3 1 1 0 0 ... 0] // 100 elements
```

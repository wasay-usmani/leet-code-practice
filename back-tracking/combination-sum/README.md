# Combination Sum (LeetCode 39)

**Problem:**
Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may use the same number from candidates an unlimited number of times.

**Function signature:**
```go
func combinationSum(candidates []int, target int) [][]int
```

**Input:**
- An array of distinct integers candidates
- An integer target

**Output:**
- A 2D array of all unique combinations that sum to target

**Example:**

Input:
```
candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
```
Output:
```
[[2,2,3],[7]]
```

# Search a 2D Matrix (LeetCode 74)

**Problem:**
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

**Function signature:**
```go
func searchMatrix(matrix [][]int, target int) bool
```

**Input:**
- A 2D matrix of integers
- An integer target

**Output:**
- true if target is found, false otherwise

**Example:**

Input:
```
matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
```
Output:
```
true
```
